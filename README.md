# Daios
a Noise Map Generation Software Made in and for Ue4/Ue5.

You can make NoiseMaps in 8000x8000(or more) pixels with 16 bits per pixel for free using this Software.

And i got a lot of ideas.

inside of the code exist functions like:

invert.

abs.

min.

max.

clamp.

terrace.

add.

(i use libnoise for create this app, and use basically the same modules).

and erode function that i Will unclude in the next realeses.
